## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You need to have the following software installed on your system:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm)
-   [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Hitesh-PSG/StudySphere.git
    cd StudySphere
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. You will need to get your own API keys from Cloudinary and Mapbox.

    ```env
    # Cloudinary credentials for image storage
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloudinary_cloud_name>
    CLOUDINARY_KEY=<your_cloudinary_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_SECRET=<your_cloudinary_api_secret>

    # Mapbox token for displaying maps
    MAP_TOKEN=<your_mapbox_access_token>

    # MongoDB connection URL (can be local or from Atlas)
    DB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/studysphere

    # Secret for session management
    SECRET=thisisagoodsecret
    ```

4.  **Start the development server:**
    The project uses `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes.
    ```sh
    nodemon app.js
    ```
    If you don't have `nodemon` installed globally, you can run:
    ```sh
    npm install -g nodemon
    ```
    Alternatively, you can just use `node`:
    ```sh
    node app.js
    ```

5.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
